# Advanced-Melanoma-Skin-Cancer-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **9 different skin cancer types**, with a focus on **melanoma detection**, using dermoscopic images.   Melanoma accounts for a large proportion of skin cancer–related deaths and early detection is critical.
